# Task_4
Aggregate Functions and Grouping in SQL
**📚 Objective**
To practice and demonstrate SQL aggregate functions and grouping for summarizing data from one or more tables using SUM, COUNT, AVG, GROUP BY, and HAVING.

🛠️ Tools
MySQL Workbench

**🚀 Features Demonstrated**

Apply aggregate functions:

SUM() — Calculate total

COUNT() — Count rows

AVG() — Compute average

Categorize data using GROUP BY

Filter grouped results using HAVING

**📜 SQL Queries Included**

Calculate total number of records in the table (COUNT).

Find average values of numeric columns (AVG).

Calculate total sum of numeric columns (SUM).

Group data based on columns like Genre, Author, Publisher, YearPublished.

Count number of records for each group.

Compute average or sum for each group.

Filter groups based on aggregate results using HAVING.

**🗂️ Files Included**

task_4.sql — SQL script file with:

Table creation

Data insertion

SQL queries using SUM, COUNT, AVG, GROUP BY, and HAVING

README.md — This file

🏃‍♂️ How to Run

**📑 Mini Guide (Mints)**

1.Apply aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG) on numeric columns like Price.

2.Use GROUP BY to categorize and summarize data based on columns like Genre, Author, Publisher, or YearPublished.

3.Use HAVING to filter grouped data based on aggregate conditions (e.g., HAVING COUNT(*) > 2).
